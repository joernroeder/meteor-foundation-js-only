# Foundation 

#### An advanced responsive web framework by [ZURB](http://zurb.com/)

> This is a smart package for use with the [Meteor open-source web platform](http://meteor.com/) and the [Meteorite package manager](http://oortcloud.github.io/meteorite/). It is meant to be downloadable from the [Atmosphere package repository](https://atmosphere.meteor.com/).

This is a JS-only version of Foundation meant to allow the use of the SCSS/Compass version of Foundation. Using the SCSS version allows for extensive customization not available in the plain CSS version.

This package does not currently handle SCSS compilation. To manage this, simply use compass watch on your Meteor project's directory.
